Certainly! **Active learning** is an efficient approach for mitigating data dependency when training neural machine translation (NMT) models. Here are some examples of how active learning has been applied in the context of NMT:

1. **Active Learning for Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**:
    
    - In a research paper titled “Active Learning for Neural Machine Translation,” the authors Neeraj Vashistha, Kriti Singh, and Ramakant Shakya explore the use of active learning techniques with NMT systems. They incorporate active learning into the NMT toolkit Joey NMT to improve low-resource language translation.
    - The approach involves selecting unlabeled data points that would be most beneficial for obtaining labels. Two model-driven acquisition functions are used for sample selection.
    - The study demonstrates that active learning helps the NMT model converge early and enhances overall translation quality. [The BLEU scores for different NMT systems (including active learning variants) are reported](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00688)[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00688).
2. **Interactive Neural Machine Translation with Active Learning**:
    
    - Another line of research focuses on interactive NMT, where a human agent interacts with the translation system to supervise the translation process.
    - In a paper titled “Active Learning for Interactive Neural Machine Translation of Data Streams,” the authors propose selecting, from an unbounded stream of source sentences, those sentences worth supervising by a human agent. The user then interactively translates those samples.
    - [This approach allows the NMT system to learn from user feedback and adapt dynamically during translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11243)[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11243).
3. **Combining Active Learning with Transfer Learning and Iterative Back-Translation**:
    
    - Researchers explore new training frameworks by incorporating active learning into various techniques such as transfer learning and iterative back-translation (IBT).
    - [By integrating active learning into these existing methods, NMT models can improve performance even under limited human translation budgets](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.162/)[3](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.162/).

In summary, active learning plays a crucial role in enhancing NMT models by selecting informative samples, improving convergence, and achieving better translation quality. Researchers continue to explore innovative ways to leverage active learning in the field of neural machine translation.
