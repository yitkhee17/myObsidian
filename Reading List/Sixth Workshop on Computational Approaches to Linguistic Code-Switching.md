| Multilingual self-supervised speech representations improve the speech recognition of low-resource African languages with codeswitching | 4/5 | #Automatic-speech-recognition, #low-resource-languages, #code-switching, #self-supervised-representations | [[cs-data-of-low-resource-language-are-too-small-to-train-model-from-scratch.]] The authors proposed a fine-tuned self-supervised speech representations ==**wav2vec 2.0 XLSR** ==to recognize code-switched data. They suggest finetuning self-supervised representations performed better with resource-limited data. | ok but its ASR | Abstract |
| Unified Model for Code-Switching Speech Recognition and Language Identification Based on Concatenated Tokenizer | 1/5 | #Code-Switching, #Automatic-speech-recognition, #Language-Identification, #Multilingual-Speech-Recognition, #Concatenated-Tokenizer | This work train cs model with monolingual data. **Concatenated Tokenizer**: reuse monolingual tokenizers to generate language ID for each text token | ok but its LID | Abstract |
| CONFLATOR: Incorporating Switching Point based Rotatory Positional Encodings for Code-Mixed Language Modeling | 5/5 | #Code-mixing, #Transformers, #Language-Modeling, #Positional-Encoding | [[Neural language model for code-switching is yet to explore.]] [[transformer cannot always encode positional information due to its non-recurrent characteristics]]. **CONFLATOR**: focus on the switching point of CS and produce smarter positional encoding  | great | Abstract |
| Prompting Multilingual Large Language Models to Generate Code-Mixed Texts: The Case of South East Asian Languages | 1/5 | #multilingual-Large-Language-Models, #zero-shot-prompting | - | no, cs data generation | abstract |
| Text-Derived Language Identity Incorporation for End-to-End Code-Switching Speech Recognition | 1/5 | #code-switching; #Automatic-speech-recognition ; #Language-Identification  #transformer | two strategy to incorporate text LID into ASR to mitigate language confusion in ASR: LID state fusion and language posterior biasing | okay but LID | abstract |
| Language Preference for Expression of Sentiment for Nepali-English Bilingual Speakers on Social Media | 0/5 | Â #code-switching, #language-preference, #sentiment-analysis, #Nepali-English | Analyse the language preference of Nepal in expressing themselves and sentiment analysis of cs conversation happened. They would expressed negative feeling in Nepal language | No | Abstract |
| Towards Real-World Streaming Speech Translation for Code-Switched Speech | 0/5 | #Speech-translation, #code-switching, #streaming-models, #spanish-german | Translate cs speech into 3rd language, on streaming mode, and release a dataset from this. | No | Abstract |
| TongueSwitcher: Fine-Grained Identification of German-English Code-Switching | 4/5 | #code-switching, #code-mixing, #corpus, #dataset, #german, #english, #mixed, #ambiguous, #interlingual, #homograph, #wordlist, #multilingual, #stemming, #german-english | produce naturally occurring german-english cs data. analyse [[language ambiguous words that can only be disambiguated by context analysis]]. [[Morphologically mixed words]] consisting of both english and German morphemes. | Yes but german-english | Abstract |
