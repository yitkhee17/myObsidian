Title: We're Afraid Language Models Aren't Modeling Ambiguity
ShortSummary: Ambiguity is an intrinsic feature of natural language. Managing ambiguity is a key part of human language understanding, allowing us to anticipate misunderstanding as communicators and revise our interpretations as listeners. As language models (LMs) are increasingly employed as dialogue interfaces and writing aids, handling ambiguous language is critical to their success. We characterize ambiguity in a sentence by its effect on entailment relations with another sentence, and collect AmbiEnt, a linguist-annotated benchmark of 1,645 examples with diverse kinds of ambiguity. We design a suite of tests based on AmbiEnt, presenting the first evaluation of pretrained LMs to recognize ambiguity and disentangle possible meanings. We find that the task remains extremely challenging, including for GPT-4, whose generated disambiguations are considered correct only 32% of the time in human evaluation, compared to 90% for disambiguations in our dataset. Finally, to illustrate the value of ambiguity-sensitive tools, we show that a multilabel NLI model can flag political claims in the wild that are misleading due to ambiguity. We encourage the field to rediscover the importance of ambiguity for NLP.

A premise is the only knowledge one knows about the subject, while a hypothesis can be in entailment (true), contradiction (false) or neutral (undetermined) states.

**Ambiguity** refers to the presence of multiple possible meanings or interpretations in a sentence or phrase. It is an intrinsic feature of natural language and plays a crucial role in human language understanding. Ambiguity allows us to anticipate misunderstandings as communicators and revise our interpretations as listeners . Ambiguity can arise due to various factors, such as the use of homonyms, polysemous words, syntactic structures, or contextual cues that can lead to multiple interpretations . Managing ambiguity is essential for the success of language models (LMs) used as dialogue interfaces and writing aids. The AmbiEnt dataset, a linguist-annotated benchmark, is designed to evaluate the ability of pretrained LMs to recognize and disentangle possible meanings of ambiguous sentences . The dataset demonstrates the challenge of disambiguation for LMs, highlighting the need for ambiguity-sensitive tools in NLP applications

**Why we need to manage language ambiguity?**

- Ambiguity is an intrinsic feature of natural language and managing it is crucial for effective communication and language understanding .
- Managing ambiguity allows us to anticipate misunderstandings as communicators and revise our interpretations as listeners .
- Language models (LMs) are increasingly used as dialogue interfaces and writing aids, making it essential for them to handle ambiguous language effectively .
- Ambiguity can lead to different interpretations and understanding, which can impact the accuracy and reliability of language models .
- Recognizing and disentangling possible meanings of ambiguous sentences is a challenging task for language models, as observed in the evaluation of pretrained LMs .
- Ambiguity-sensitive tools, such as multilabel NLI models, can help identify and flag misleading claims in political discourse that are due to ambiguity .
- Managing language ambiguity is important for the field of natural language processing (NLP) to improve the performance and reliability of language models and other NLP applications

**No, the paper does not explicitly mention whether the observed ambiguity is limited to a single language or not.** The paper focuses on the characterization and evaluation of ambiguity in sentences, the challenges faced by language models in recognizing and disentangling possible meanings, and the practical relevance of ambiguity-sensitive tools in natural language processing (NLP) applications **[**1**]**. While the paper does not provide specific information about the languages included in the AmbiEnt dataset, it emphasizes the importance of managing ambiguity in language understanding and the need for improved disambiguation capabilities in language models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the paper's observations and findings are applicable to natural language ambiguity in general, rather than being limited to a single language..
