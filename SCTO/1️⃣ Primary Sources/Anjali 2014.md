- To highlight the importance and challenges of resolving ambiguity for various NLP applications
- To suggest some possible directions for future research on disambiguation techniques

#### Key insights

- Ambiguity is a pervasive and inherent feature of natural language that poses significant difficulties for computational models of language processing
- [Ambiguity can occur at different levels of language analysis, such as lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,ntpquery,devtoolsapi,udsdlpconsent,&shellsig=452a8cf1313eef232fc519c4b9d57009888ff87b&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C2%7C4e4ddd4a-275d-4f9b-b4c3-1777d1fccd65%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22Ambiguity%20...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22pdf%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22file%253A%252F%252F%252FC%253A%252FUsers%252FWong%252FDesktop%252Fambiguities-in-natural-language-processing.pdf%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A16%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22Ambiguity%20could%20be%20Lexical%2C%20Syntactic%2C%20Semantic%2C%20%5Cr%5CnPragmatic%20etc.%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D)[3](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/chat?udsframed=1&form=SHORUN&clientscopes=chat,noheader,udsedgeshop,channelstable,ntpquery,devtoolsapi,udsdlpconsent,&shellsig=452a8cf1313eef232fc519c4b9d57009888ff87b&setlang=en-US&darkschemeovr=1#sjevt%7CDiscover.Chat.SydneyClickPageCitation%7Cadpclick%7C2%7C4e4ddd4a-275d-4f9b-b4c3-1777d1fccd65%7C%7B%22sourceAttributions%22%3A%7B%22providerDisplayName%22%3A%22Ambiguity%20...%22%2C%22pageType%22%3A%22pdf%22%2C%22pageIndex%22%3A1%2C%22relatedPageUrl%22%3A%22file%253A%252F%252F%252FC%253A%252FUsers%252FWong%252FDesktop%252Fambiguities-in-natural-language-processing.pdf%22%2C%22lineIndex%22%3A16%2C%22highlightText%22%3A%22Ambiguity%20could%20be%20Lexical%2C%20Syntactic%2C%20Semantic%2C%20%5Cr%5CnPragmatic%20etc.%22%2C%22snippets%22%3A%5B%5D%7D%7D)
- Ambiguity can affect the performance and accuracy of NLP applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, etc.
- Ambiguity resolution requires linguistic tools, lexical resources, contextual knowledge, pragmatic inference, and world knowledge
- Ambiguity resolution methods can be rule-based, statistical, or hybrid, depending on the type and level of ambiguity, the availability of data, and the domain and task of the application
