Several techniques have been proposed by previous researchers to handle code-switching in Neural Machine Translation (NMT):

1. [**Checks and Strategies for Enabling Code-Switched Machine Translation**: This research proposes checks to measure the switching capability of NMT models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf)[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf). [It also investigates simple and effective data augmentation methods that can enhance an NMT model’s ability to support code-switching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf)[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf). [The effectiveness of these methods in improving robustness is demonstrated using a glass-box analysis of attention modules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf)[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05096.pdf).
    
2. [**Code-Switching Pre-training (CSP) for Neural Machine Translation**: CSP is a new pre-training method proposed for NMT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf)[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf). [Unlike traditional pre-training methods which randomly mask some fragments of the input sentence, CSP randomly replaces some words in the source sentence with their translation words in the target language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf)[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf). [This method enhances the NMT model’s ability to handle code-switched text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf)[2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08088.pdf).
    
3. [**Word Sense Pretraining for Neural Machine Translation (WSP-NMT)**: This is an end-to-end approach for pretraining multilingual NMT models leveraging word sense-specific information from Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14050v1)[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14050v1). [The method has shown significant improvements in overall translation quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14050v1)[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14050v1).
    

These techniques represent some of the latest advancements in handling code-switching in NMT. They aim to improve the robustness and translation quality of NMT models when dealing with code-switched text.
