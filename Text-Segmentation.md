Yes, a neural network can be used to split input text into segments. [This process is often referred to as text segmentation](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/text-segmentation-approaches-datasets-and-evaluation-metrics/). [Text segmentation is the task of dividing a document of text into coherent and semantically meaningful segments which are contiguous](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/text-segmentation-approaches-datasets-and-evaluation-metrics/). [This task is important for other Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications like summarization, context understanding, and question-answering](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/text-segmentation-approaches-datasets-and-evaluation-metrics/).

There are several techniques for text segmentation:

1. [**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: RNNs are particularly well-suited for sequence data like text](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf). [They can be trained to recognize patterns across different parts of the text and use this information to segment the text](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf).
    
2. [**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: LSTM is a type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf). [This makes it useful for text segmentation tasks where the context from earlier in the text can be important](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf).
    
3. [**Transformers**: Transformer models, like BERT or GPT, have been very successful in many NLP tasks](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf). [They can be used for text segmentation by training them to predict the boundaries between segments](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf).
    
4. [**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: CNNs can also be used for text segmentation](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf). [They can learn to recognize local patterns within the text, which can be useful for identifying segment boundaries](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf).
    

Remember, the choice of model can depend on the specific requirements of your task. [Itâ€™s important to consider factors such as the complexity of the task, the availability of training data, and the computational resources at your disposal](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[1](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1214/reports/final_reports/report001.pdf)[2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/text-segmentation-approaches-datasets-and-evaluation-metrics/).
