**How to separate intra-word into language segments during language identification process in code-switched context?**
**To improve language identification model that can separate the intra-word into language segments and label them with language tag using Segmental Recurrent Neural Network**

In the context of code-switching, where two or more languages are alternated in conversations, intra-word code-switching occurs when words are composed of morphemes from more than one language. [To separate intra-word into language segments during the language identification process, you can extend the language identification task to the subword level](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf)[1](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf).

Hereâ€™s a high-level approach:

1. [**Subword-Level Language Identification**: This involves splitting mixed words while tagging each part with a language ID](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf)[1](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf). For instance, if a word is composed of English and Spanish morphemes, each morpheme would be tagged with its respective language ID.
    
2. [**Use of a Segmental Recurrent Neural Network**: A model based on a segmental recurrent neural network can be proposed for this task](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf)[1](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf). This type of network can handle the complexity of identifying different language segments within a single word.
    
3. [**Language ID Tag Set**: The language ID tag set can consist of tags for each language involved, a tag for intra-word code-switching (MIXED), and tags for other elements like punctuation, numbers, emoticons, symbols, etc](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf)[1](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf).
    
4. [**Handling Named Entities**: Named entities can be tagged with a combination of NE and their language ID](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf)[1](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1201.pdf).
    

Remember, this is a complex task and the effectiveness can depend on the languages involved and the quality of the training data.
