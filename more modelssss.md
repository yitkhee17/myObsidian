Sure, here are a couple of machine learning models that have been used for identifying cross-lingual homographs:

1. [**Supervised Learning Framework with Word Sense Disambiguation**: This model uses word sense disambiguation to effectively deal with homographs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60). [The framework is trained on a dataset from Twitter containing significant homographs](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60). [Various classification methods are used to evaluate the framework, and the random forest algorithm has been found to perform the best among all with an F1-measure of 97.94](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60).
    
2. [**Multilingual Models like mBERT, XLM, and XLM-Roberta**: These models are used in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and can comprehend multiple languages](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-3963-3_7). [They are trained on large, unlabeled text corpora and use techniques like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-3963-3_7). [These models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including language identification](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-3963-3_7).
    

Remember, the effectiveness of these models can depend on the languages involved and the quality of the training data.
