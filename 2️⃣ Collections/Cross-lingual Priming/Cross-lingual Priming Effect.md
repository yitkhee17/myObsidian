cross-lingual priming is a effect cause by the occurrence of word A in language I, affecting the processing of word A in language B.

**prior experience in one language can influence the processing of words in another language**, 
especially for words that have the same form but different meanings across languages

- processing of cognates may be speeded up, 
- processing of interlingual homographs may be delayed.
