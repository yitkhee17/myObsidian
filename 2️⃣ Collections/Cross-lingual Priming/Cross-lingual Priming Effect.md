cross-lingual priming is an effect cause by the occurrence of word in language A, affecting the processing of that word in language B.

**prior experience in one language can influence the processing of words in another language**, 
especially for words that have the same form but different meanings across languages

- processing of cognates may be speeded up, 
- processing of interlingual homographs may be delayed.
