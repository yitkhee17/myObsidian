when we process a word, we engage in a complex dance of pronunciation, understanding, translation (if applicable), and activation in our mental lexicon.
1. Pronunciation
		When we process a word, we often start by pronouncing it in our minds or even aloud.For example, if you encounter the word “apple,” you might mentally say its pronunciation: /ˈæpəl/.
2. Understanding
		Understanding a word involves grasping its meaning. This understanding allows us to connect the word to our existing knowledge. This can happen at different levels:    
		1. Lexical Level: Recognizing that “apple” refers to a fruit.
		2. Semantic Level: Understanding that an apple is a sweet, edible fruit typically with red or green skin.
3.  Translation
	If you encounter the word “pomme” (French for “apple”), your mind might automatically connect it to the English word “apple.” So, processing involves recognizing the translation equivalence between words in different languages.
4. Activation of Mental Lexicon:
	1. Our mental lexicon is like an internal dictionary where we store information about words. When we process a word, we activate its representation in this mental lexicon. This activation influences subsequent processing of related words.
5. Speed and Accuracy
	1. - Processing speed matters. If you recognize a word quickly, it suggests efficient processing. Accuracy matters too. Correctly identifying the meaning of a word is crucial.
6. Task Specific Processing
	1. Different tasks (e.g., reading, listening, speaking, or semantic judgments) involve distinct aspects of word processing.
	2. Cross-lingual priming studies use tasks like semantic relatedness (judging how related two words are) or lexical decision (deciding if a string of letters is a valid word).
