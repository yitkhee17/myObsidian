There are several machine learning models and techniques that can be used for the function of detecting the language affiliation of cross-lingual homographs:

1. [**Supervised Learning Frameworks**: These frameworks can effectively deal with homographs by using word sense disambiguation in the perspective of language identification](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60). [They can be trained on a dataset of significant homographs to distinguish their language](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60). [Various classification methods can be used, and results show that the random forest algorithm performs the best among all with the F1-measure of 97.94](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60).
    
2. [**Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA) Model**: This model supports the initial non-selective access to competing language representations](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/letter-detection-for-homographs-with-different-meanings-in-different-language-texts/CDA9FE3A6733B4CB20A702986C3B1E73)[2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/letter-detection-for-homographs-with-different-meanings-in-different-language-texts/CDA9FE3A6733B4CB20A702986C3B1E73). [It can assess inter-lingual homographs in the absence of connected text](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/letter-detection-for-homographs-with-different-meanings-in-different-language-texts/CDA9FE3A6733B4CB20A702986C3B1E73). [However, it’s important to note that the selectivity is in response to post-lexical processes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/letter-detection-for-homographs-with-different-meanings-in-different-language-texts/CDA9FE3A6733B4CB20A702986C3B1E73)[2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/letter-detection-for-homographs-with-different-meanings-in-different-language-texts/CDA9FE3A6733B4CB20A702986C3B1E73).
    
3. [**GAN-Based Multilingual Sentence Representation Mappings**: This technique can be used for cross-language plagiarism detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16976-2_9). [It can potentially be adapted for the task of cross-lingual homograph language affiliation detection](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-6631-6_60)[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16976-2_9).
    

Remember, the choice of model can depend on the specific requirements of your task. It’s important to consider factors such as the complexity of the task, the availability of training data, and the computational resources at your disposal.
