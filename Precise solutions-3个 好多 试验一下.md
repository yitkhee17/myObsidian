Cross-lingual homographs are words that are spelled the same across different languages but have different meanings. Identifying these during the language identification process can be challenging. Here’s a high-level approach based on machine learning techniques:

1.

It involves determining the meaning of a word based on its context. This can help in identifying the language of a homograph.
